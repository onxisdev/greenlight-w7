## Streaming stats

During the stream you can show debug statistics that contain extra data about the buffer queues and other information. To bring this up you can press `~` on your keyboard.

At the bottom-left you can see the status (although not always accurate). At the top-right you can find the FPS of the video and audio decoders including the latency. At the bottom-right you can find debug information about the buffer queues and other information that is useful for debugging perposes.

When possible always provide this information with your issue, if it is related.

## Online friends list

The application also provides a way to see which of your friends are online. This can be useful when you want to quickly check if anyone is online to play with :)

## Steam Deck Setup

This application is reported to be working on the Steam Deck with some small bugs and side-effects. You can map one of the Steam Deck back buttons to the 'N' key to simulate the Xbox button.

## Optional launch arguments
